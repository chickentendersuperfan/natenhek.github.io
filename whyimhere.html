                <h1>Why am I here?</h1>
                <p>That's a good question. I'm in this course because I have some interest in web development. Web development seems to be 
                    in relatively high demand, and it would be nice to learn some new things and gain some experience.</p>
                <p>I have mild experience in web development. I took CPSC 332 File Structures and Databases, where we used HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.</p>
                <p>I also created a website with some of my friends in a CPSC 362 Software Engineering. It's running, but it's still a work in progress.</p>
                <p>I'm hoping to learn more about how web development works and gain more experience in Javascript.</p>
